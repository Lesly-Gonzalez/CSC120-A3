Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Juniper Huang, Priscilla Trejo, Lily Gao, Michelle and Glory.

Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Unfortunately, I was not able to attend TA hours for this assignment.

 What are your initial impressions of Java? 
 I had some experience with JavaScript, so I felt a little familiar with some of the syntax (for loops, semicolons.) However, I have more experience with Python. I got frustrated several times because I had an idea of how to do things in Python, but was not sure on how to translate that to Java. 

 Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
 I can see the resemblance between Python and Java as they both use loops, variables, classes, input. However, the "how" to implement all of that in Java is still a source of frustration. I hope to get more comfortable using Java as this semester progresses.

 What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
 -Starting early and writing pseudocode at the beggining allowed me to break the assignment into smaller, easier to approach, pieces. 
 -Explaining my though process, and listening to other's approach was very helpful. 
 -Many things in Java are still confusing. I whish we had more time to do exersices before having to complete an assignment.
 -For someone planning to take this course I would recommend spending time practicing, watching videos, and reading about object-oriented programming in Java.
